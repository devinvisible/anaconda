'''Display and screen management.

Rendering is performed on a `Canvas`, which conceptually could be an
off-screen buffer, the content area of a `Window`, or an entire screen.
Currently, canvases can only be created with windows (though windows can be
set fullscreen).

Windows and canvases must belong to a `Display`.  On Windows and Mac OS X
there is only one display, which can be obtained with `get_display`.  Linux
supports multiple displays, corresponding to discrete X11 display connections
and screens.  `get_display` on Linux returns the default display and screen 0
(``localhost:0.0``); if a particular screen or display is required then
`Display` can be instantiated directly.

Within a display one or more screens are attached.  A `Screen` often
corresponds to a physical attached monitor, however a monitor or projector set
up to clone another screen will not be listed.  Use `Display.get_screens` to
get a list of the attached screens; these can then be queried for their sizes
and virtual positions on the desktop.

The size of a screen is determined by its current mode, which can be changed
by the application; see the documentation for `Screen`.
